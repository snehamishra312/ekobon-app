    PLANT_TREES_HEADER: `Trees are important part of our ecosystem. Often known as
                                the ‘lungs of the Earth’, they play a key role in storing
                                carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The plethora of
                                benefits they unlock includes stabilizing the soil,
                                preventing climate change, controlling humidity, and
                                preventing flooding. As such, planting and preserving the
                                trees provide a great opportunity to reduce our carbon
                                footprint and curb global warming.`,

    PLANT_TREES_QUESTION3: "Understanding carbon sequestration:",
    PLANT_TREES_QUESTION4: "What species absorb the most CO2?",
    PLANT_TREES_ANSWER1:
      "The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing the temperatures to rise rapidly. This can be attributed to human activities such as deforestation, using air conditioners, increasing automobiles, overconsumption, etc. Trees have the amazing ability to absorb carbon and return oxygen. Planting trees is thus the most effective way to stop global warming. Trees are known as carbon sinks. They use the carbon they absorb for photosynthesis and growth. Later they can lock carbon in their branches, roots and trunk",
    PLANT_TREES_ANSWER2:
      "Planting more trees will make way for carbon sequestration, help to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as energy source, and replace materials like aluminum and PVC that are extracted using energy-intensive processes.",
    PLANT_TREES_ANSWER3:
      "Carbon emissions per person vary based on their lifestyle (food, transport, housing etc). On average, it is 6 tons per person per year globally. Although the carbon absorption capacity can vary, trees in general store about 30-40 kg of CO2 per year, or 1 ton of CO2 per year for 20-30 mature trees. Thus over 150 trees will be needed to compensate for the annual emissions of a person.",
    PLANT_TREES_ANSWER4:
      "Not all trees are equally eco-efficient. The carbon absorption capacity of trees varies based on species, age, size, weather conditions, soil type, etc. Some trees grow more quickly than others and therefore absorb CO2 faster, as is the case with eucalyptus. However, some other special grow slow and live longer. This enables them to absorb more CO2 in their lifetime, such as oak or beech.",

      "To get a comprehensive idea of how the carbon footprint for a flight, is calculated, let's take an example.  A short flight of 2 hours duration and 1000 km in distance produces about 94kg of CO2. ",
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE12: `This calculation on the Ekobon tool takes into account approach-avoidance and maneuvers of nearly 95 km. The amount of kerosene used per kilometer is 2.7 kg and thus will be 2.95 tonnes for the trip.`,
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE2: `Take-offs, landings, and taxiing are fuel-intensive and the tool accounts for that in its calculations. The amount accounted for a 1000 km flight is 1.1 tonnes. Thus, 4.01 tonnes of kerosene is used for the trip. The amount is higher for long-haul flights and those with layovers.`,
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE3: `Now, 3.1kg Co2 is produced per kg of kerosene consumed. Thus, the tool will compute the net carbon footprint as 12.43 tonnes for the flight. The tool attributes the carbon footprint to cargo loads well and that is estimated at 7% for short flights and 26% for long haul flights.`,
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE4: `Hence for this 1000 km flight, 93% of CO2 emissions are to be shared by passengers. Short-haul flights mostly use planes with 150 seats. The tool assumes an occupancy rate of 82% to reach a figure of 122 passengers that will share the CO2 load with you.`,
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE5: `Among the many considerations that the tool makes, it also attributes more carbon emissions to economy and first-class seats as they take proportionally more space.`,
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE6: `Apart from CO2, aircraft fuel combustion also generates NOx which is a greenhouse gas. Since NOx cannot be absorbed by trees, we strive to eliminate CO2 in an amount equal to the NOx released. Thus the tool doubles the CO2.`,
    FOOTPRINT_FLIGHT_SENTENCE7: `The complex calculation that takes into account all these considerations reaches a figure of 94kg emissions for the short flight.`,
